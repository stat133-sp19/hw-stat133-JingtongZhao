Cooking Recipe for Crispy Rice and Egg Bowl
===========================================

### Ingredients

-   1 1/4 cups minced scallions
-   2 tablespoons minced or finely grated fresh ginger
-   Neutral oil
-   1/4 cup sherry or rice wine vinegar
-   Fine sea salt
-   1 heaped cup julienned or coarsely grated carrots
-   8 ounces small (Persian-style, about 2) cucumbers
-   3 cups cooked, cooled rice
-   4 eggs
-   Soy sauce or tamari
-   Toasted sesame oil
-   Sriracha, gochujang or another hot sauce of your choice

### Special tools

-   Large frying pan
-   Spatula

### Steps

1.  **Crisp the rice.**
2.  **Make the vinaigrette**: Mix scallions, ginger, 1/4 cup oil and sherry or rice wine vinegar in a bowl. Season with salt (I use about 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt). Set aside.
3.  **Crisp your egg**: If there isn’t enough oil left in the pan (you want a thin layer), add another splash and heat this on high heat. Add eggs one at a time and season lightly with salt and pepper. Cook until brown, lacy, and crisp underneath, and the whites are opaque, bubbly and dramatic and the edges are brown. You can spoon some oil from the pan over the egg whites to help them cook faster. Place one egg on each bowl of rice.
4.  **Assemble bowls**: Arrange some cucumbers and carrots to each bowl. Spoon 2 tablespoons vinaigrette onto each bowls. Drizzle each egg with a half-teaspoon of tamari and toasted sesame oil, letting it roll onto the other ingredients, plus hot sauce to taste. Eat immediately. Repeat frequently.

There's **no** special season of the year for Crispy Rice and Egg!!You can cook it every day!! You can replace carrots and cucumbers with any vegetables you like, such as potatoes, mushrooms, and tomatoes.

Euclidean Distance
==================

### Definition

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\mathbf{\\overline{pq}}$)

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p1, p2,..., pn*) and **q** = (*q1, q2,..., qn*) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$
\\begin{aligned}
d(\\mathbf{p,q})=d(\\mathbf{q,p}) = &\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2 +(q\_2-p\_2)^2+ \\dots+ (q\_n-p\_n)^2}\\\\= &\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{10} (q\_i-p\_i)^2}
\\end{aligned}
$$
 The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$
\\Vert{\\mathbf{p}}\\Vert=\\sqrt{(p\_1)^2 +(p\_2)^2+ \\dots+ (p\_n)^2} = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot \\mathbf{p}}
$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
