In this workout, a shiny app is created to help visualization of three saving/investing modes, including no contribution, fixed contribution , and growing contribution in an interactive way. Users will be able to change the initial amount, annual contribution , return rate, growth rate and years of investment and see corresponding balances in plots and tables. Users can also choose if the plots are facetted or not.
