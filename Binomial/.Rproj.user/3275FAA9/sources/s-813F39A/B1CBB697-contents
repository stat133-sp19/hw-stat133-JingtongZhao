## Binomial

## Calculating combinations
The first step is to use factorial() to write a function bin_choose() that calculates the number of combinations in which k successes can occur in n trials.
```{r}
combination = bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)
combination
```

## Calculating probability
The next step is to calculate probabilities about the number of successes in a fixed number of trials performed under identical conditions. Function bin_choose() is used to calculate combinations.
```{r}
probability = bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
probability
```

## Probability distribution
Based on the probability calcualted by bin_probability(), now we can see probabilities corresponding to different success values out of a fixed number of trials. Bin_distribution() returns a data frame with the probability distribution: sucesses in
the first column, probability in the second column.
```{r}
distribution = bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
distribution
```


## Plot of probability distribution
You can use the function `plot()` to create a barplot to display the probability histogram 
of a binomial distribution object "bindis"
```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(distribution)
```

## Cumulative probability distribution
Based on the calculation from bin_distribution(), bin_cumulative() calculates the cumulative probability of successes. It generates a data frame with both the probability distribution and the cumulative probabilities: sucesses in the first column, probability in the second column, and cumulative in the third column.
```{r}
cumulative = bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
cumulative
```

## Plot of probability distribution
You can use the function `plot()` to plot the cumulative distribution of object "bincum"
```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(cumulative)
```

## Binomial Variable
bin_variable() takes in trials and prob and returns a list with trials: number of trials and prob: probability of success.
```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
```

The `summary()` function gives you paramaters(trials, success) and measuresï¼š
```{r}
summary(bin1)
```

## Functions of measures
main functions for each of the summary measures: e.g. bin_mean(), bin_variance(), bin_mode(), bin_skewness(), bin_kurtosis(). 
```{r}
bin_mean(10, 0.3)
bin_variance(10, 0.3)
bin_mode(10, 0.3)
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)
```
